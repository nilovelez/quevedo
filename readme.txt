Quevedo is a suite of tools for bloggers and content creators.

== Description ==

Quevedo is a set of tools aimed at those authors, writers or bloggers who want to use WordPress for writing. It removes some unnecessary features for single-author sites and improves SEO, but without complications.

WordPress was born as a small blogging tool. Over the years it has grown and now serves for many more things, but deep down there is still a lot of that little blogging tool. Quevedo helps you focus on what matters: writing.
